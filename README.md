JPPA Campaign Finance
===============

In the interest of promoting the highest levels of financial transparency, the Justice Party of Pennsylvania
maintains this repository of archived monthly financial reports and raw accounting data.

Raw accounting data is presented in *.QIF files, which are data exports from Intuit's Quicken software.  However,
these files are importable to many other accounting applications (including GnuCash), and are also viewable in
plain text format.

We encourage people to assist us by conducting audits of our financial records and by providing suggestions for
improving our reporting formats.

When conducting an audit, it may be beneficial to compare this data to what was reported by us to the Federal
Election Commission.  You can find our reported information by searching for **Committee ID# C00542118** on the
[FEC's Candidate and Committee Viewer](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/candcmte_info.shtml).
